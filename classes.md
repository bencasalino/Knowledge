JavaScript is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language we can use to model real-world items. In this lesson, you will learn how to make classes. Classes are a tool that developers use to quickly produce similar objects.

Take, for example, an object representing a dog named halley. This dog's name (a key) is "Halley" (a value) and has an age (another key) of 3 (another value). We create the halley object below:

```
let halley = {
  _name: 'Halley',
  _behavior: 0,

  get name() {
    return this._name;
  },

  get behavior() {
    return this._behavior;
  },

  incrementBehavior() {
    this._behavior++;
  }
}
```

Now, imagine you own a dog daycare and want to create a catalog of all the dogs who belong to the daycare. Instead of using the syntax above for every dog that joins the daycare, we can create a Dog class that serves as a template for creating new Dog objects. For each new dog, you can provide a value for their name.

As you can see, classes are a great way to reduce duplicate code and debugging time.

After we lay the foundation for classes in the first few exercises, we will introduce inheritance and static methods — two features that will make your code more efficient and meaningful.

```
// example class
class Dog {
  constructor(name) {
    this._name = name;
    this._behavior = 0;
  }

  get name() {
    return this._name;
  }
  get behavior() {
    return this._behavior;
  }

  incrementBehavior() {
    this._behavior ++;
  }
}
```

```
const halley = new Dog('Halley');
console.log(halley.name); // Print name value to console
console.log(halley.behavior); // Print behavior value to console
halley.incrementBehavior(); // Add one to behavior
console.log(halley.name); // Print name value to console
console.log(halley.behavior); // Print behavior value to console
```
