# jQuery

The jQuery library contains the following features:

- HTML/DOM manipulation

- CSS manipulation

- HTML event methods

- Effects and animations

- AJAX

In addition, jQuery has plugins for almost any task out there.

The jQuery team knows all about cross-browser issues, and they have written this knowledge into the jQuery library. jQuery will run exactly the same in all major browsers.

CDN

One big advantage of using the hosted jQuery from Google or Microsoft:

Many users already have downloaded jQuery from Google or Microsoft when visiting another site. As a result, it will be loaded from cache when they visit your site, which leads to faster loading time. Also, most CDN's will make sure that once a user requests a file from it, it will be served from the server closest to them, which also leads to faster loading time.
