#BEM

BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) naming convention

Basic explanation would be:
Elements that are standalone are called Blocks.

Secondly, elements that are not standalone (they rely on parent) are called Elements (in this case it is modal\_\_element).

Thirdly, there're modifiers, they're used to make small change to existing element (eg. change color).

The syntax for modifier is : block\_\_element--modifier
