## First-Class Functions / Higher Order Functions

Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them, are called higher-order functions. The term comes from mathematics, where the distinction between functions and other values is taken more seriously.

Higher-order functions allow us to abstract over **actions**, not just values.

A programming language is said to have First Class Functions when a function in that language are treated like any other variable.

A function can be...

> passed as an argument to another function
> can be returned by another function
> can be assigned as a value to a variable
