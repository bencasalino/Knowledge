###### NPM Installing devDependencies

While setting up your code in production:
With the --production flag (or when the NODE_ENV environment variable is set to production), npm will not install modules listed in **devDependencies**.

npm install --production

**NOTE:** The --production flag has no particular meaning when adding a dependency to a project.
